# Spring Boot Template for Microservices

- This template is intended for the microservice architecture
- Kafka is included in this template
- Sample classes are included
- **This template uses annotation based routing**
- **Intended for personal use only as this does not include complete features like JHipster**

    - Very slow to compile
    - `arm64` is not supported by GitHub by default
